**Introduction**:

Customer churn prediction has become a critical concern across various industries, including subscription-based businesses, financial services, e-commerce platforms, and telecommunications. Churn, which refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their association with a business, poses significant financial and operational challenges. Businesses invest substantial resources in acquiring customers, making retention a strategic priority. Reducing churn is crucial as retaining an existing customer is often more cost-effective than acquiring a new one. Organizations rely on predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning and take proactive measures to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
Traditional machine learning models have played a significant role in churn prediction, achieving high accuracy levels. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines have been widely used to analyze customer behavior and predict churn probability. However, while these models provide reliable predictions, they often lack interpretability. The "black-box" nature of many machine learning models makes it challenging for businesses to understand the underlying factors driving customer churn. Without clear insights into why a model predicts a customer is likely to churn, organizations struggle to design effective retention strategies. This limitation highlights the need for explainable machine learning techniques that go beyond accuracy and provide actionable insights into customer behavior.
To address this challenge, this research proposes an advanced churn prediction framework that integrates Ensemble Learning for accuracy, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for interpretability, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for continuous model improvement. This comprehensive approach enhances both predictive performance and transparency, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions with confidence.
Ensemble Learning is a powerful technique that combines multiple classifiers to improve predictive performance. Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble methods leverage the strengths of multiple algorithms, leading to more robust and reliable predictions. Popular ensemble techniques include Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Bagging, which includes methods like Random Forest, reduces variance by averaging predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets of data. Boosting, used in algorithms like XGBoost and AdaBoost, sequentially improves weak models by focusing on misclassified instances. Stacking combines multiple base learners and uses a meta-model to make final predictions. By employing these ensemble methods, the proposed framework ensures high accuracy in churn prediction, reducing false positives and false negatives.
While achieving high accuracy is essential, businesses also need to understand the reasoning behind churn predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques provide transparency by uncovering the key factors influencing customer behavior. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) helps in identifying the most significant features contributing to churn. This technique enables organizations to interpret predictions at both global(entire dataset) and local (individual customer) levels. By analyzing feature importance, businesses can pinpoint trends such as frequent complaints, reduced transaction frequency, or low engagement levels that indicate an increased likelihood of churn. This interpretability empowers decision-makers to take personalized retention measures based on meaningful insights.
A key limitation of traditional churn prediction models is their static nature. Most machine learning models rely on historical data for training, making them less effective in adapting to evolving customer behaviors and market trends. To overcome this limitation, this research incorporates Reinforcement Learning (RL) into the churn prediction framework. RL enables continuous learning by allowing the model to interact with new data, receive feedback, and adjust its predictions dynamically.
In this framework, churn predictions generated by the ensemble model and interpreted through XAI techniques are fed into an RL-based loop. This loop refines the model by learning from customer interactions, feedback from retention strategies, and real-time market trends. For instance, if a retention campaign succeeds in preventing churn for certain customer segments, the RL algorithm updates its learning parameters to reinforce similar recommendations in the future. This adaptive learning mechanism ensures that the churn prediction model remains relevant and effective in changing business environments.
The proposed churn prediction framework offers a holistic solution by combining three advanced AI techniques: Ensemble Learning, Explainable AI, and Reinforcement Learning. Ensemble Learning ensures high predictive accuracy, XAI provides interpretability, and RL facilitates continuous self-improvement. This integrated approach not only enhances the reliability of churn predictions but also equips businesses with actionable insights to develop proactive retention strategies. By addressing the limitations of traditional machine learning models, this research contributes to a more effective and intelligent customer retention system that can drive long-term business success.

Dataset Link:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction?select=E+Commerce+Dataset.xlsx

The dataset contains 5,631 records with 20 attributes, designed for predicting customer churn in an e-commerce. The data set belongs to a leading online E-Commerce company. An online retail (E commerce) company wants to know the customers who are going to churn, so accordingly they can approach customer to offer some promos. The target variable, Churn, is a binary indicator showing whether a customer has left the service. The attributes in the dataset are as follows:

1.	CustomerID- Unique customer ID.
2.	Churn – Churn Flag (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
3.	Tenure - Duration of customer subscription (months).
4.	PreferredLoginDevice – Type of devices.
5.	CityTier – Type of City.
6.	WarehouseToHome- Distance in between warehouse to home of customer(km).
7.	PreferredPaymentMode- Preferred payment method of customer.
8.	Gender – Gender of Customer.
9.	HourSpendOnApp- Number of hours spend on mobile application or website.
10.	NumberOfDeviceRegistered- Total number of deceives is registered on particular customer.
11.	PreferedOrderCat-: Preferred order category of customer in last month.
12.	SatisfactionScore- Satisfactory score of customer on service.
13.	MaritalStatus- Marital status of customer.

Figure represents the working of a model integrated with the system in real time. After collecting user data of e-commerce domains, pre-processing and feature engineering is applied. Ensemble model is trained on this dataset and churn is predicted. For the churn predicted, Explainable AI gives insight regarding the same. Over a period of time, if the prediction fails for a particular customer, retention actions like offers, discounts and others are triggered as guided by the business managers, else regular engagement continues. Feedback is stored whether the retention actions applied actually worked or not as well as whether the customers with low churn probability, on whom no actions were taken, stayed or not. The history of feedback is maintained for future reference. With real time data storage, the model is retrained iteratively on new user data to improve its performance and adapt to changes over time. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of its working:

**1. Data Collection from E-Commerce Domain**
The first step involves collecting user data from e-commerce platforms. The dataset consists of various attributes (as listed earlier), such as customer tenure, preferred login device, order history, complaints, payment methods, and more. These attributes provide valuable insights into customer behaviour.

**2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, it undergoes preprocessing:
•	Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
•	Handling Imbalance Dataset: Using SMOTE Technique as there were 20% records for Churn-1 and rest for Churn-0.
•	Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables (e.g., gender, preferred payment mode) into numerical format using techniques.

**3. Training an Ensemble Machine Learning Model**
Once the data is pre-processed, it is used to train an ensemble model for churn prediction. Ensemble models combine multiple algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and robustness. The technique used is:
•	LightGBM: LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a high-performance, distributed, and efficient gradient boosting framework developed by Microsoft. It is designed to handle large-scale data and provides fast training speed, lower memory usage, and better accuracy compared to traditional gradient boosting methods.
The trained model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (1) or stay (0).

**4. Explainable AI (XAI) for Churn Prediction Insights**
After making churn predictions, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are used to provide transparency into why a customer is likely to churn. Some methods include:
•	SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations): Highlights which features (e.g., low satisfaction score, fewer orders, increased complaints) contributed most to the churn prediction.
This insight is valuable for business managers, helping them understand the key reasons behind customer churn.

**5. Retention Strategies Based on Prediction Outcomes**
Once the churn probability is determined, two scenarios arise:
Scenario 1: High Churn Probability (Customer Likely to Leave) → Apply Retention Strategies
If the model predicts that a customer is likely to churn, retention actions are triggered. These actions are guided by business managers and can include:
•	Discounts & Offers: Special coupons, cashback points.
The system tracks whether these strategies successfully retain the customer or not.
Scenario 2: Low Churn Probability (Customer Likely to Stay) → Regular Engagement Continues
For customers predicted to stay (low churn risk), no special retention actions are applied. 

**6. Feedback Storage & Continuous Learning**
To ensure continuous improvement, the system stores feedback on past predictions and retention strategies:
•	For High Churn Customers: Did the applied retention action (coupon, cashback) work?
•	For Low Churn Customers: Did they continue shopping as predicted?
This feedback is stored in a historical database for future analysis.

**7. Model Retraining with Real-Time Data**
Over time, customer behaviors change due to new trends, economic conditions, or marketing strategies. To adapt to these changes, the churn prediction model is iteratively retrained using real-time customer data.
This ensures that the model:
•	Learns from past prediction failures.
•	Improves accuracy over time.
•	Adapts to changing customer behaviours dynamically.
